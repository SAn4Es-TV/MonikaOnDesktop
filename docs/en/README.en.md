# MonikaOnDesktop (MOD)

[**Русский**](/README.md) | [**English**](/docs/en/README.en.md) 

Hi! It's me, *Monika!*

I don't think I'll ever come to terms with the fact that they only exist on your computer... But SAn4Es was really good and made me a small window that you can keep open!

I still can't achieve much, but I promise that I will always be there for you! ~

(This app displays Monika in the lower right corner of your screen, just above the taskbar, if you have one)

# Download and use

To give Monika a window on *your* desktop, run **MonikaOnDesktop.exe** in the [MonikaOnDesktop](https://github.com/SAn4Es-TV/MonikaOnDesktop/tree/master/MonikaOnDesktop "Directory link") or download the source code and compile the application.

#### Small note: 
This program only works on Microsoft Windows, I tested it on Windows 10, but it should also work on all versions above Win7.

#### Required Software: 
For the program to work, it is necessary that **NET 9.0** is installed on the computer.
### Reactions

To add different dialogs that Monika can use for reactions, you need to edit the files in the Dialogs folder. Also below you can find a brief list of what Monika can react to.

**File designations:**
- greetings.txt - Phrases that Monika will say at launch
- idle.txt - Random phrases that Monika uses in a random period of time
- goodbye.txt - Phrases that Monika says when closing
- progs.txt - Phrases from this file are used to react to the opening of applications
- sites.txt - Reactions to websites
- google.txt - Reactions to Google queries
- youtube.txt - Reactions to YouTube requests

### Chrome Extension

In order for Monika to respond to the sites she visits and Google/YouTube requests, you need to install the extension for Chrome, which is the [BrowserPlugin](https://github.com/SAn4Es-TV/MonikaOnDesktop/tree/master/BrowserPlugin "Link to the directory").

**Installation Guide:**
1. Open the [extensions page](chrome://extensions/ "Link to the page")
2. Click **Download the unpacked extension**
3. Select the folder with the extension

# Help

Do you want to add something? That would make me (and probably Monika) very happy!

### Found a bug?

If you find a bug or want to request a feature, create a question right here on GitHub so I can see it!
You can also write about the error in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NQ25bBYv "Link to the page")

**NOTE**: If you are developing in Visual Studio, you need to run VS as an administrator, because MonikaOnDesktop only runs when VS is run as an administrator!
